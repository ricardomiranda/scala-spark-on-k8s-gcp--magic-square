    * With the magic square problem, both the genes and the order of the genes

    * chromosome. This is because it would create an invalid solution because a number
    * can not be in the solution more than once. 
    * Because of this, it's essential that we find and apply a crossover
    * method that produces valid results for our problem.
    * We also need to be respectful of the ordering of the parent's chromosomes
    * during the crossover process. This is because the order of the chromosome
    * the solution's fitness. In fact, it is only the order that matters.
    * Here we will aply ordered crossover.
